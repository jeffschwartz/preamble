# Preamble v3.0.1

### JavaScript BDD Testing Framework

**_Preamble_** is a powerful JavaScript BDD testing framework backed by a powerful assertion engine that your suites interface with through a simple to use but powerful API. Preamble makes the task of authoring tests easy, intuitive and even fun.

**_Preamble v3_** introduces numerous new API features and enhancements:

1. A rich BDD semantic API
2. Enhanced support for test doubles: spies, stubs, fakes, and mocks.

** Breaking Changes **

Because of the extent and nature of the features that have been added, _test scripts written for versions of Preamble prior to v3 will not work_. In addition, _numerous APIs have been added, changed or removed entirely_. This was unfortunate but absolutely necessary in order to move Preamble forward. Please read the documentation for complete details.
