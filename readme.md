# Preamble v3.1.0

### JavaScript BDD Testing Framework

**_Preamble_** is a powerful JavaScript BDD testing framework backed by a powerful assertion engine that your suites interface with through a simple to use but powerful API. Preamble makes the task of authoring tests easy, intuitive and even fun.

**_Preamble v3_** introduces numerous new API features and enhancements:

1. A rich BDD semantic API
2. Enhanced support for test doubles: spies, stubs, fakes, and mocks.

** Breaking Changes **

Because of the extent and nature of the features that have been added, _test scripts written for versions of Preamble prior to v3 will not work_. In addition, _numerous APIs have been added, changed or removed entirely_. This was unfortunate but absolutely necessary in order to move Preamble forward. Please read the documentation for complete details.

To install the Preamble browser-based standalone spec runner on your computer (beginning with v3.1.0):

1. From the [releases page](https://github.com/jeffschwartz/preamble/releases) download the standalone spec-runner for the version of Preamble that you are targeting.
2. Create a new folder on your computer and copy the standalone distribution file that you just downloaded to that folder.
3. Make the folder you just created the current folder and **_unzip_** the standalone distribution.
