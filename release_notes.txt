v3.0.3
Enhancements
o When calling expect(fn), where fn is an ordinary function and not a spy, fn is
now first converted to a spy, then called, and then the spy is used as the
actual value for the expectation.

v3.0.2
Bug Fixes
o Corrected 'toBeCalledWithContext(object)' suite in sample-suite.js.

v3.0.1
Bug Fixes
o Fixed bug in Args.prototype.hasArgProperty and ACall.prototype.hasArgProperty
methods that would cause them to fail.

v3.0.0
Enhancements
o BDD all the way!

v2.2.0
Enhancements
o Report header now remains fixed and will not scroll when scrolling Report
output.

v2.1.0
Enhancements
o Short circuiting a running test suite immediately after the first test fails
is now supported via the "shortCircuit" configuration property when it is set to
boolean true (it defaults to boolean false).
o When running headless via PhantomJS the test suite name, coverage and duration
are now displayed in the console output.
Bug Fixes
o Report coverage now reports the correct number of tests actually run when
filtering (e.g "Ran 4 of 51 tests"). This will also report the correct number of
tests run when using the new "shortCircuit" option (see Enhancements above).
o Report summary now displays "All tests passed" when there are no failures.
This fixes the issue of the wrong number being reported for total tests passed
when filtering.
